## What is version control? (1)

## What is version control? (2)

* A system that keeps records of your changes
* Allows for collaborative development
* Allows you to know who made what changes and when
* Allows you to revert any changes and go back to previous states

## Git - Introduction (1)

* DVCS = Distributed Version Control System
* Started in 2005
* Created by Linus Torvald to aid in Linux kernel development
* Users keep entire code and history on their local machines
    - Offline work possible
    - Pushing \& pulling from remote server

    

## Git - Introduction (2)

* Consists of two parts
    - "Database" to hold project history
    - Set of tools to interact with database (command line, GUI)
* Technique for managing coding projects:
    - Large: Yahoo, twitter
    - Small: Me > 1 mio other people

## GitHub

* Founded in 2008
* Largest web-based git repository hosting service
* Allows for code collaboration with anyone online
* Provides extra functionality, e.g. bug tracking, documentation, Wiki
* Plenty of additional resources: guides.github.com and tutorials

# Why do we want to use Github?

## Welcome to - [KempaLab](https://github.com/KempaLab/)

* Platform-independent lab repository 
* Good practices in R programming \& RStudio
* Co-working projects for:
    - Protocols
    - Documentation
    - Data analysis \& visualisation
    - Coding
    - Reports

# Basic concepts \& terminology

## Terminology

* Repository
* Cloning
* Staging
* Commit
* remote vs. local
* Push vs. pull
* Branching
* Merging


## Commits - snapshots of your project (1)

## Repositories

## Cloning - copy remote repos to local machines

## Pulling vs. Pushing

# The classical workflow

## Starting place - your work directory
![commit1](images/git006.pdf)

## Add new files - staging

## Create a new commit

## Push your local updates to a remote

# Github concept of branches and merging

## Branching (1)

* Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. 
* For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. 
* Once you're done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the master branch. 
* When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files.

## Summary - terminology

* _repository_ (repo): Your git project - remote or local
* _commit_: a snapshot of your project at time point x
* _branch_: your git project in a new context
* _clone_: copy a remote repo to a local machine
* _push_: upload local changes to a remote repo
* _pull_: download updates from a remote repo
* _stage_: add modified content from your working directory for commit
* _merge_: integrate a branch into another 

# Little stories

## Git in RStudio

* Convinient integration in RStudio
* Either via command line integrated Terminal
* Or Git pane (upper right)

# LetÂ´s play around

## What we are going to do now

* Explore your github account and browser
* Create your first repository
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Modify the file, save it and push it to the remote
