## What is version control? (1)

## What is version control? (2)

* A system that keeps records of your changes
* Allows for collaborative development
* Allows you to know who made what changes and when
* Allows you to revert any changes and go back to previous states

## Git - Introduction (1)

* DVCS = Distributed Version Control System
* Started in 2005
* Created by Linus Torvald to aid in Linux kernel development
* Users keep entire code and history on their local machines
    - Offline work possible
    - Pushing \& pulling from remote server

    

## Git - Introduction (2)

* Consists of two parts
    - "Database" to hold project history
    - Set of tools to interact with database (command line, GUI)
* Technique for managing coding projects:
    - Large: Yahoo, twitter
    - Small: Me > 1 mio other people

## GitHub

* Founded in 2008
* Largest web-based git repository hosting service
* Allows for code collaboration with anyone online
* Provides extra functionality, e.g. bug tracking, documentation, Wiki
* Plenty of additional resources: guides.github.com and tutorials

# Why do we want to use Github?

## Welcome to - [KempaLab](https://github.com/KempaLab/)

* Platform-independent lab repository 
* Good practices in R programming \& RStudio
* Co-working projects for:
    - Protocols
    - Documentation
    - Data analysis \& visualisation
    - Coding
    - Reports

# Basic concepts \& terminology

## Terminology

* Repository
* Cloning
* Staging
* Commit
* remote vs. local
* Push vs. pull
* Branching
* Merging


## Commits - snapshots of your project (1)

## Repositories

## Cloning - copy remote repos to local machines

## Pulling vs. Pushing

# The classical workflow - creating a new commit

## Starting place - your work directory

## Add new files - staging

## Create a new commit

## Push your local updates to a remote

# Github concept of branches and merging

## Branching (1)

* Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. 
* For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you're done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the master branch. 
* When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files.

## Merging branches

* Integration of new features into master branch
* `git merge master new-feature`
